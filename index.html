            This is one of my favourite pictures from my trip to Vietnam - it
            was taken not long after we arrived, in a cafe near our
            accommodation. We wanted to get something to eat at this place but
            the language barrier prevented us, we did have an excellent iced
            coffee though.

            Both of these shots were taken at the same location in Edinburgh
            just minutes apart. The overcast day created the perfect backdrop
            for the light bulb in the window.

            Another shot from my Trip to Vietnam. I was worried that my film
            would get ruined on this trip - I'd heard that airport X-ray
            machines could damage the film. My film went through an X-ray
            machine 8 times over the course of the trip and I don't think it
            impacted the results too much.

            This was taken in Edinburgh during the Christmas Market period. It
            was also one of the first photos taken on a film camera of a nearby
            subject that I actually managed to get in focus. Result!

            This is the view from the top of North Berwick Law. When you see the
            surroundings from up there it's obvious why so many people want to
            live in North Berwick.
